Ampache Mediaserver Interface

The Ampache Mediaserver Interface is a bridge between an Ampache
media server and a DBus MediaServer2Spec client.  It uses data
provided by the Ampache XML API.

Ampache Mediaserver Interface is meant to be used in conjuction
with Rygel for which it will present itself as an external
plugin.

Rygel will in turn present the information from Ampache as UPnP
A/V (DLNA) data.

= Installation =

see file INSTALLATION

= Configuration =

On first run, the program needs to be run with the following
command line arguments to initialize the connection to the
Ampache API:

  -a, --ampache_uri_base     Specify base URI of Ampache instance.
  -u, --username             Specify username to authenticate with Ampache instance.
  -p, --password             Specify password to authenticate with Ampache instance.

= Usage =

On startup, the program checks for updates of the Ampache
database.  If there was an update, the program reacquires all
data.

A reacquisition of all data can be forced with the following
command line argument:

  -f, --force-update         Force reread of Ampache data.

A reacquisition of all data during runtime can be triggered by
sending the SIGUSR1 signal to the programs process.
